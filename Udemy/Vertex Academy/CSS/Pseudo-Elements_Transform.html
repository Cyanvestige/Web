	<p>This fifth edition of Lang's book covers all the topics traditionally taught in the first-year calculus sequence. Divided into five parts, each section of A FIRST COURSE IN CALCULUS contains examples and applications relating to the topic covered. In addition, the rear of the book contains detailed solutions to a large number of the exercises, allowing them to be used as worked-out examples - one of the main improvements over previous editions.</p>
